- aws sns create topic
### We'll create a SNS topic
`aws sns create-topic --name billing alarm`
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email
`aws sns subscribe \
  --topic arn TopicARN \
  --protocol email \
  --notification-endopoint your@email.com`
once its created, check your email and confirm the subscription.
## Create Alarm

- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generate earlier.
- We are just a json file because --metrics is required expression and so its easier to us a JSON file.
